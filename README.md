# First Flutter Application 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

This is my **first mobile application developed using Flutter**.
The project was created to understand the **basics of Flutter**, **Dart programming**, and **cross-platform mobile development**.

The app demonstrates how Flutter builds user interfaces using **widgets** and how a single codebase can run on **Android and iOS**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

The main goals of this project were:

* To learn **Flutter project structure**
* To understand **Dart language basics**
* To practice using **widgets** (Stateless & Stateful)
* To build and run a mobile app successfully
* To understand hot reload and UI updates

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Flutter** – UI toolkit for building natively compiled apps
* **Dart** – Programming language used by Flutter
* **Android Studio / VS Code** – Development environment
* **Android Emulator / Physical Device** – Testing

---

## 📱 App Features

* Simple and clean user interface
* Flutter default widgets
* Responsive layout
* Demonstrates basic navigation *(if used)*
* Beginner-friendly code structure
